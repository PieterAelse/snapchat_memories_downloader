# About SnapchatMemoriesDownloader
A simple application to download your memories from your Snapchat MyData.

This tool was created after discovering that in order to download the actual images/videos two steps are needed;
1. Do a POST with the "downloadlink" (app.snapchat.com/dmd/memories?something) to get the actual downloadlink (something.amazonaws.com/someMoreThings)
2. Download the media using that actual download link.

Next to that I wanted the files to have the original timestamp as creation date. 
Oh and of course to not do this whole stupid process manually :man_facepalming:Ô∏è
